# express-boilerplate

![Express Status](https://github.com/jcockbain/express-boilerplate/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)

This is my personal Node.js Express server boilerplate.

## Instructions

### Develop Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run start: dev
```

The app will open by default on <http://localhost:5000>. This can be changed by adding a `PORT` environment variable.

This will run with `nodemon`, and live update on code changes. To run without `nodemon`,  run  `npm start`.
